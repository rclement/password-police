Password Police provides a list of password policies for online services,
available as a browsable web-application and a REST API.

It is largely inspired by [TwoFactorAuth.org](https://twofactorauth.org).

## Goal

Having a comprehensive list of password policies for online services,
so that one can maximize the security of passwords used on the web.

Providing a browsable web-application is a first step for the curious and security-conscious,
but ideally integrating the REST API with password managers could be a more user-friendly solution:
imagine if your password manager were to generate a secure password,
already within the maximum limits of each online service! üöÄ
